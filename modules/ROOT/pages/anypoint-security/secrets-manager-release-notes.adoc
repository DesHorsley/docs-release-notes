This Secrets Manager release has the following fixed issue:

=== Users Unable to Perform Actions in Secrets Manager

When users of business groups accessed the Secrets Manager user interface, the `do not have permission` error occurred when trying to perform actions in Secrets Manager. This happened even though the master organization (or a parent of a business group) had the *API Manager Environments* entitlement.

FIX:
If the master organization has the *API Manager Environments* entitlement, users of the child business groups are now able to access Secrets Manager functionality.
