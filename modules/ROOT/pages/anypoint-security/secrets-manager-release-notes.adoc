This Secrets Manager release has the following fixed issue:

=== Users Unable to Perform Actions in Secrets Manager

When users of business groups accessed the Secrets Manager user interace, they got a 'do not have permission' error when trying to perform any action in Secrets Manager. This happened even though the master/parent organization of the business group the user was a member of had the 'API Manager Environments' entitlement. 

FIX:
If the master/parent organization has the 'API Manager Environments' entitlement, users of child business groups are now able to access Secrets Manager functionality.
