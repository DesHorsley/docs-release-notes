This Secrets Manager release has the following fixed issue:

=== Users Unable to Perform Actions in Secrets Manager
When users of sub orgs accessed the Secrets Manager UI, they got a 'do not have permission' error
when trying to perform any action in Secrets Manager. This happened even though the master/parent org of the sub org the user was a member of had the '[API Manager] Environments' entitlement. 

FIX:
If the master/parent org has the '[API Manager] Environments' entitlement, sub orgs are now able to access Secrets Manager functionality.
