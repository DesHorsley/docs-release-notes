== 2.0.0

*September 2018*

=== New Features and Enhancements

To provide a better experience using this module, MuleSoft added a new API
to support archiver compression formats with a new set of operations. It
retains the experience for compressing and decompressing files for each
of the available formats without losing any of the features that the format
associated algorithm provides.

This change enables the possibility of adding more compression formats in
a simple way. This version now supports the most widely used compression
format: ZIP.

The Gzip format is still supported.
