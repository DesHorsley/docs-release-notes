== New Features and Enhancements
////

== Changes

Regarding API Gateway capabilities:

Of the various bugs fixed, noteworthy is fix AGW-2631. The issue occurred when an API previously tracked was deleted from API Manager and then the runtime was restarted. Now, by default, in that scenario, all policies that were previously applied will continue to be applied, including existing contracts that are locally cached. If you want stricter security, you can control this behavior by specifying the following system property:

`anypoint.platform.policies.on_api_deleted=block_api|keep_policies(default)`

== Known Limitations and Workarounds

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-15603 | Values of `AsyncInterceptingMessageProcessor maxThreadsActive` and `minThreadsActive` are not accurate.
| EE-6181 | Use deadlock safe strategy for transaction logging.
|===


== Upgrade Requirements

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-8817 | `spring-messaging` was upgraded from 4.1.9 to 4.3.17.
| MMULE-15004 | The HTTP listener's socket server timeout default was changed from 0 to 60 seconds, while respecting the `connectionIdleTimeout` settings.
| MULE-15264 | Message attachments now respect the order of their introduction, meaning that their addition order will match the order in which they are sent to external services, and the order in which they are received from external services will match the order in which they are stored.
| MULE-15344 | HTTP will now follow RFC-2616 to determine the mime type when no Content-Type header is sent but data is available (using `application/octet-stream`). When no data is available it will now use `*/*`.
|===
