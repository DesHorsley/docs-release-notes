*March 20, 2018*

This release fixes an important issue related to the handling of Mule runtime exceptions by the APIkit router.

The following behavior was fixed: the execution of the flow in the router might result in a MuleException, a MuleRuntimeException, or an Exception. APIkit was only handling the first one by rethrowing it. The others were wrapped in a DefaultMuleException, which is mapped to an UNKNOWN error.

== Compatibility

* Mule Runtime 4.0.0+
* Anypoint Studio 7.0.2

== Fixed in this Release

* APIkit Router incorrectly wraps MuleRuntimeException. (APIKIT-1129)
