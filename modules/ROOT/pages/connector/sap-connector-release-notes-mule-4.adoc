=== Fixed in this Release

* Out of memory when retrieving data from SAP due to XML serialization. Solved by changing XML serialization implementation.
* Fixed empty metadata name issue that caused the metadata generation to fail. The empty entries were removed so only the valid ones end up in the XML.
* Fixed source not sending the response back to SAP in case of export parameters. Solved by implementing handling for this scenario.
