== 2.0.0

*July 18, 2018*

=== Min Mule Version
*Mule 4.1.0*

=== New Features and Enhancements

The main difference in this version with respect to v1.1.0 is how the `publish-consume` operation manages errors. In previous versions, if the flow at the receiving end failed, the operation would fail with a `VM:QUEUE_TIMEOUT` error.

In this new version, a `VM:PUBLISH_CONSUMER_FLOW_ERROR` will be thrown instead, signaling the difference between a timeout and an actual failure. Notice however that it's still possible for the `publish-consume` operation to fail with a timeout error, if the receiving flow doesn't fail but doesn't respond in time either.
