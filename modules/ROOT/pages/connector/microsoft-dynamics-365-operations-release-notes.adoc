=== Fixed in this Release

* Dynamic 365 for Operations Connector was not refreshing the OAuth token after expiration because the expiration timestamp sent by the server was not taken into consideration. Now the token is refreshed.
* Import Data Recurring Job was not working because the payload of the operation was not properly sent to the API. Now, it is working properly.
