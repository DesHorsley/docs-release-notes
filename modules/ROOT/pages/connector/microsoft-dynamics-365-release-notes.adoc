MuleSoft provides OAuth 2.0 Connection and Username-Password access to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 server.

*January 9, 2019*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.7.x, 3.8.x, and 3.9.x
|Microsoft Dynamics 365 | 1.0.10
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* Enhanced exception handling in case of bad credentials.
* The plus sign (*+*) was not correctly encoded when executing a query, which caused the operation to not return the results.

== 1.0.6

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.6.0 and later
|Microsoft Dynamics 365 | 1.0.6
|===

=== Features

* No new features added.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Dynamics 365 Connector stopped making calls after the maximum number of connections (maxHttpConnections). Even if no value was set, it stopped when 100 (default value) was reached. The issue was fixed by removing the HTTP request from the request pool.
* Under certain scenarios, connections were being kept open after performing requests. This was fixed.

=== Known Issues

* No known issues.


== 1.0.5

[width="100%", cols="50a,50a", options="header"]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.6.0 and newer
|Microsoft Dynamics 365 | 1.0.5
|===

=== Features

* No new features added

=== Fixed in this Release

* An issue was reported that when using a payload with Czech characters in the connector, an error is returned even if the Mule message
is set to use __UTF-8__ encoding.
It was fixed by using the correct __UTF-8__ encoding in the requests to the Dynamics 365 service.

=== Known Issues

* No known issues


== 1.0.4

*July 24, 2018*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.6.0 and later
|===

=== Features

* No new features added.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Fixed Read Timeout default value. Default was always 5 seconds even if setting was not specified or set to 0.
Now, if ReadTimeout is not specified, the default is 5 seconds, else if ReadTimeout is less or equal to 0 (zero),
the default is an infinite wait.

=== Known Issues

* No known issues.

== 1.0.3

*May 23, 2018*

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.6.0 and later
|===

=== Features

* No new features added.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Dynamics 365 Connector was not releasing immediately the connections with an error response (HTTP error code >= 400).
 The Olingo protocol doesn't release a connection immediately if the response is not consumed, so we forced the connector to consume the response even if it's an error response.

=== Known Issues

* No known issues.

== 1.0.2

*April 27, 2018*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.6.0 and later
|===

=== Features

* No new features added.

=== Fixed in this Release

* This connector was throwing a TimeOutException after receiving a 204 response from the API for an update operation. This was happening because the HTTP client we are using has some memory leaks and we had to override the default implementation.
* This connector was throwing a TimeOutException after 30 seconds even if the configured timeout value was greater. Now the exception is thrown after the configured timeout value.
* This connector was creating a new connection for each request, not using the maximum number of connections configured in the pool. Another issue here was that the connections were never released. Now the issues are fixed.
* This connector does not refresh OAuth token after expiration.
* Creating an entity with a GUID using this connector throws metadata error.
* This connector does not support `Edm.Date`.
* Fixed the `edm.datetimeoffset` issue.
* Null values not accepted for Int32 fields.
* Error when converting decimal fields.
* Unauthorized (HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized) error raised when token expired.

== 1.0.0
