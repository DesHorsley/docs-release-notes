== What's New

In this release, we have made some changes regarding TLS support in Studio and embedded runtimes (Mule and API Gateway). As TLS 1.0 is no longer accepted by PCi compliance and many companies (e.g. Salesforce has started to https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?id=000221207[disable it]), we have started to move towards enabling more users to adopt TLS 1.1 and 1.2 as default. The specifics are as following:

. API Gateway 1.3.2, 2.0.3 and 2.1.0 still have TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 enabled by default.
. API Gateway 2.1.1, 2.0.4 and 2.2.0 have TLS 1.0 *disabled* by default, with 1.1 and 1.2 enabled by default.
. Mule 3.7.3 has TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 enabled by default.
. We encourage all users to use TLS 1.1/1.2. This release has made the change to expose TLS default setting in Studio folder, which makes it easy for users to custom configure. For users who want to use TLS 1.0 with newer API Gateway and Mule runtimes that do not have 1.0 enabled by default, please refer to documentation here for xref:3.7@mule-runtime::tls1-0-migration.adoc[configuration instruction].

In addition to this, we included bug fixes and performance improvements. For a complete list, please see the JIRA list below.


== Migration Guide

From the previous versions of Studio 5.1.0, 5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1, 5.3.0, 5.4.1 and 5.4.2, there is no special migration needed, but when opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.


[NOTE]
Studio as an Eclipse plugin only works with Eclipse 4.3 or 4.4 due to an SWT dependency.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.
====

[NOTE]
When updating using the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, it's important that you choose to update all components marked in the update wizard.

== Eclipse Plugin

If you are using Studio as an Eclipse plugin, you can get this version of Studio using the Eclipse update site `+http://studio.mulesoft.org/r4/plugin+`.

This allows you to download Anypoint Studio core and third-party components version 5.x.x and with an embedded version of Mule Runtime v3.7.x along with other optional components. +
